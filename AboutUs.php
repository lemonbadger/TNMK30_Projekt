        <p class="ShortIntro">We are four students from Link√∂ping University, Sweden. We are all studying to 
            get a degree of science in engineering and this site is one of our projects. 
            The purpose for us with this project is to learn how to develop a webpage and 
            adapt it for as many people as possible.
            The purpose is also that you, yes you, can use our webpage to search in our 
            database after a specific lego piece you have. Our webpage will then provide you
            with information about your piece such as what set it belongs to.
